*AWS infrastructure that includes a Lambda function to process CSV file results, save images to an AWS S3 Bucket, and store product data in DynamoDB. The implementation seamlessly integrates Java-powered Lambda functions through AWS Gateway API, enabling the development of diverse front-end solutions. Two distinct front-end applications were realized using JSP and Angular pages with the Bootstrap framework, delivering a consistent user experience across multiple platforms.*
